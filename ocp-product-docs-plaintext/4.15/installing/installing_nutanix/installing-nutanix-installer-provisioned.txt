# Installing a cluster on Nutanix


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.15, you can choose one of the following options to install a cluster on your Nutanix instance:
Using installer-provisioned infrastructure: Use the procedures in the following sections to use installer-provisioned infrastructure. Installer-provisioned infrastructure is ideal for installing in connected or disconnected network environments. The installer-provisioned infrastructure includes an installation program that provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster.
Using the Assisted Installer: The Assisted Installer hosted at console.redhat.com. The Assisted Installer cannot be used in disconnected environments. The Assisted Installer does not provision the underlying infrastructure for the cluster, so you must provision the infrastructure before the running the Assisted Installer. Installing with the Assisted Installer also provides integration with Nutanix, enabling autoscaling. See Installing an on-premise cluster using the Assisted Installer for additional details.
Using user-provisioned infrastructure: Complete the relevant steps outlined in the Installing a cluster on any platform documentation.

# Prerequisites

* You have reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
* The installation program requires access to port 9440 on Prism Central and Prism Element. You verified that port 9440 is accessible.
* If you use a firewall, you have met these prerequisites:
* You confirmed that port 9440 is accessible. Control plane nodes must be able to reach Prism Central and Prism Element on port 9440 for the installation to succeed.
* You configured the firewall to grant access to the sites that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform requires. This includes the use of Telemetry.
* If your Nutanix environment is using the default self-signed SSL certificate, replace it with a certificate that is signed by a CA. The installation program requires a valid CA-signed certificate to access to the Prism Central API. For more information about replacing the self-signed certificate, see the  Nutanix AOS Security Guide.

If your Nutanix environment uses an internal CA to issue certificates, you must configure a cluster-wide proxy as part of the installation process. For more information, see Configuring a custom PKI.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Use 2048-bit certificates. The installation fails if you use 4096-bit certificates with Prism Central 2022.x.
----

# Internet access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, you require access to the internet to
install
your cluster.

You must have internet access to:

* Access https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.
* Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.
* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.

# Internet access for Prism Central

Prism Central requires internet access to obtain the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image that is required to install the cluster. The RHCOS image for Nutanix is available at rhcos.mirror.openshift.com.

# Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

During an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
----


[NOTE]
----
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific
approaches such as
AWS key pairs.
----

1. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your ~/.ssh directory.

[NOTE]
----
If you plan to install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures, do not create a key that uses the ed25519 algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the rsa or ecdsa algorithm.
----
2. View the public SSH key:

```terminal
$ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
```


For example, run the following to view the ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub public key:

```termanal
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

3. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

[NOTE]
----
On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_dsa are managed automatically.
----
1. If the ssh-agent process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:

```terminal
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Example output

```terminal
Agent pid 31874
```


[NOTE]
----
If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA.
----
4. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```terminal
$ ssh-add <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Example output

```terminal
Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
```


* When you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.

# Obtaining the installation program

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on
 the host you are using for installation.

* You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with 500 MB of local disk space.

1. Access the Infrastructure Provider page on the OpenShift Cluster Manager site. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.
2. Select your infrastructure provider.
3. Navigate to the page for your installation type, download the installation program that corresponds with your host operating system and architecture, and place the file in the directory where you will store the installation configuration files.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both files are required to delete the cluster.
----

[IMPORTANT]
----
Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider.
----
4. Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux
operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
```

5. Download your installation https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager]. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components.

# Adding Nutanix root CA certificates to your system trust

Because the installation program requires access to the Prism Central API, you must add your Nutanix trusted root CA certificates to your system trust before you install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

1. From the Prism Central web console, download the Nutanix root CA certificates.
2. Extract the compressed file that contains the Nutanix root CA certificates.
3. Add the files for your operating system to the system trust. For example, on a Fedora operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
# cp certs/lin/* /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors
```

4. Update your system trust. For example, on a Fedora operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
# update-ca-trust extract
```


# Creating the installation configuration file

You can customize the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster you install on
Nutanix.

* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
* You have verified that you have met the Nutanix networking requirements. For more information, see "Preparing to install on Nutanix".

1. Create the install-config.yaml file.
1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and run the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir <installation_directory> 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.

When specifying the directory:
* Verify that the directory has the execute permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.
* Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
2. At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:
1. Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.

[NOTE]
----
For production Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.
----
2. Select nutanix as the platform to target.
3. Enter the Prism Central domain name or IP address.
4. Enter the port that is used to log into Prism Central.
5. Enter the credentials that are used to log into Prism Central.

The installation program connects to Prism Central.
6. Select the Prism Element that will manage the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
7. Select the network subnet to use.
8. Enter the virtual IP address that you configured for control plane API access.
9. Enter the virtual IP address that you configured for cluster ingress.
10. Enter the base domain. This base domain must be the same one that you configured in the DNS records.
11. Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.

The cluster name you enter must match the cluster name you specified when configuring the DNS records.
2. Optional: Update one or more of the default configuration parameters in the install.config.yaml file to customize the installation.

For more information about the parameters, see "Installation configuration parameters".

[NOTE]
----
If you are installing a three-node cluster, be sure to set the compute.replicas parameter to 0. This ensures that cluster's control planes are schedulable. For more information, see "Installing a three-node cluster on Nutanix".
----
3. Back up the install-config.yaml file so that you can use
it to install multiple clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The install-config.yaml file is consumed during the installation process. If
you want to reuse the file, you must back it up now.
----

Required. The installation program prompts you for this value.
The controlPlane section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the compute section must begin with a hyphen, -, and the first line of the controlPlane section must not. Although both sections currently define a single machine pool, it is possible that future versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform will support defining multiple compute pools during installation. Only one control plane pool is used.
Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or hyperthreading. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to Disabled. If you disable simultaneous multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster machines.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance.
----
Optional: Provide additional configuration for the machine pool parameters for the compute and control plane machines.
Optional: Provide one or more pairs of a prism category key and a prism category value. These category key-value pairs must exist in Prism Central. You can provide separate categories to compute machines, control plane machines, or all machines.
TThe cluster network plugin to install. The default value OVNKubernetes is the only supported value.
Optional: Specify a project with which VMs are associated. Specify either name or uuid for the project type, and then provide the corresponding UUID or project name. You can associate projects to compute machines, control plane machines, or all machines.
Optional: By default, the installation program downloads and installs the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image. If Prism Central does not have internet access, you can override the default behavior by hosting the RHCOS image on any HTTP server and pointing the installation program to the image.
Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead.

[IMPORTANT]
----
When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
----
Optional: You can provide the sshKey value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.

[NOTE]
----
For production Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.
----

## Configuring failure domains

Failure domains improve the fault tolerance of an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster by distributing control plane and compute machines across multiple Nutanix Prism Elements (clusters).


[TIP]
----
It is recommended that you configure three failure domains to ensure high-availability.
----

* You have an installation configuration file (install-config.yaml).

1. Edit the install-config.yaml file and add the following stanza to configure the first failure domain:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
compute:
# ...
platform:
  nutanix:
    failureDomains:
    - name: <failure_domain_name>
      prismElement:
        name: <prism_element_name>
        uuid: <prism_element_uuid>
      subnetUUIDs:
      - <network_uuid>
# ...
```


where:
<failure_domain_name>:: Specifies a unique name for the failure domain. The name is limited to 64 or fewer characters, which can include lower-case letters, digits, and a dash (-). The dash cannot be in the leading or ending position of the name.
<prism_element_name>:: Optional. Specifies the name of the Prism Element.
<prism_element_uuid>:: Specifies the UUID of the Prism Element.
<network_uuid>:: Specifies the UUID of the Prism Element subnet object. The subnet's IP address prefix (CIDR) should contain the virtual IP addresses that the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster uses. Only one subnet per failure domain (Prism Element) in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster is supported.
2. As required, configure additional failure domains.
3. To distribute control plane and compute machines across the failure domains, do one of the following:
* If compute and control plane machines can share the same set of failure domains, add the failure domain names under the cluster's default machine configuration.
Example of control plane and compute machines sharing a set of failure domains

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
compute:
# ...
platform:
  nutanix:
    defaultMachinePlatform:
      failureDomains:
        - failure-domain-1
        - failure-domain-2
        - failure-domain-3
# ...
```

* If compute and control plane machines must use different failure domains, add the failure domain names under the respective machine pools.
Example of control plane and compute machines using different failure domains

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
compute:
# ...
controlPlane:
  platform:
    nutanix:
      failureDomains:
        - failure-domain-1
        - failure-domain-2
        - failure-domain-3
# ...
compute:
  platform:
    nutanix:
      failureDomains:
        - failure-domain-1
        - failure-domain-2
# ...
```

4. Save the file.

## Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have
an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the
install-config.yaml file.

* You have an existing install-config.yaml file.
* You reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the Proxy object's spec.noProxy field to bypass the proxy if necessary.

[NOTE]
----
The Proxy object status.noProxy field is populated with the values of the networking.machineNetwork[].cidr, networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr, and networking.serviceNetwork[] fields from your installation configuration.
For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the Proxy object status.noProxy field is also populated with the instance metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254).
----

1. Edit your install-config.yaml file and add the proxy settings. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 1
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 2
  noProxy: example.com 3
additionalTrustBundle: | 4
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle> 5
```

A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The
URL scheme must be http.
A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.
A comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with . to match subdomains only. For example, .y.com matches x.y.com, but not y.com. Use * to bypass the proxy for all destinations.
If provided, the installation program generates a config map that is named user-ca-bundle in
the openshift-config namespace that contains one or more additional CA
certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections. The Cluster Network
Operator then creates a trusted-ca-bundle config map that merges these contents
with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) trust bundle, and this config map is referenced in the trustedCA field of the Proxy object. The additionalTrustBundle field is required unless
the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust
bundle.
Optional: The policy to determine the configuration of the Proxy object to reference the user-ca-bundle config map in the trustedCA field. The allowed values are Proxyonly and Always. Use Proxyonly to reference the user-ca-bundle config map only when http/https proxy is configured. Use Always to always reference the user-ca-bundle config map. The default value is Proxyonly.

[NOTE]
----
The installation program does not support the proxy readinessEndpoints field.
----

[NOTE]
----
If the installer times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the wait-for command of the installer. For example:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
```

----
2. Save the file and reference it when installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named cluster that uses the proxy
settings in the provided install-config.yaml file. If no proxy settings are
provided, a cluster Proxy object is still created, but it will have a nil
spec.


[NOTE]
----
Only the Proxy object named cluster is supported, and no additional
proxies can be created.

# Configuring IAM for Nutanix

Installing the cluster requires that the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) operate in manual mode. While the installation program configures the CCO for manual mode, you must specify the identity and access management secrets.

* You have configured the ccoctl binary.
* You have an install-config.yaml file.

1. Create a YAML file that contains the credentials data in the following format:
Credentials data format

```yaml
credentials:
- type: basic_auth 1
  data:
    prismCentral: 2
      username: <username_for_prism_central>
      password: <password_for_prism_central>
    prismElements: 3
    - name: <name_of_prism_element>
      username: <username_for_prism_element>
      password: <password_for_prism_element>
```

Specify the authentication type. Only basic authentication is supported.
Specify the Prism Central credentials.
Optional: Specify the Prism Element credentials.
2. Set a $RELEASE_IMAGE variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

3. Extract the list of CredentialsRequest custom resources (CRs) from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \1
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \2
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> 3
```

The --included parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
Specify the location of the install-config.yaml file.
Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the CredentialsRequest objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.
Sample CredentialsRequest object

```yaml
  apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
  kind: CredentialsRequest
  metadata:
    annotations:
      include.release.openshift.io/self-managed-high-availability: "true"
    labels:
      controller-tools.k8s.io: "1.0"
    name: openshift-machine-api-nutanix
    namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
  spec:
    providerSpec:
      apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
      kind: NutanixProviderSpec
    secretRef:
      name: nutanix-credentials
      namespace: openshift-machine-api
```

4. Use the ccoctl tool to process all CredentialsRequest objects by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ccoctl nutanix create-shared-secrets \
  --credentials-requests-dir=<path_to_credentials_requests_directory> \1
  --output-dir=<ccoctl_output_dir> \2
  --credentials-source-filepath=<path_to_credentials_file> 3
```

Specify the path to the directory that contains the files for the component CredentialsRequests objects.
Optional: Specify the directory in which you want the ccoctl utility to create objects. By default, the utility creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run.
Optional: Specify the directory that contains the credentials data YAML file. By default, ccoctl expects this file to be in <home_directory>/.nutanix/credentials.
5. Edit the install-config.yaml configuration file so that the credentialsMode parameter is set to Manual.
Example install-config.yaml configuration file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: cluster1.example.com
credentialsMode: Manual 1
...
```

Add this line to set the credentialsMode parameter to Manual.
6. Create the installation manifests by running the following command:

```terminal
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory> 1
```

Specify the path to the directory that contains the install-config.yaml file for your cluster.
7. Copy the generated credential files to the target manifests directory by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cp <ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests/*credentials.yaml ./<installation_directory>/manifests
```


* Ensure that the appropriate secrets exist in the manifests directory.

```terminal
$ ls ./<installation_directory>/manifests
```

Example output

```text
cluster-config.yaml
cluster-dns-02-config.yml
cluster-infrastructure-02-config.yml
cluster-ingress-02-config.yml
cluster-network-01-crd.yml
cluster-network-02-config.yml

# Adding config map and secret resources required for Nutanix CCM

Installations on Nutanix require additional ConfigMap and Secret resources to integrate with the Nutanix Cloud Controller Manager (CCM).

* You have created a manifests directory within your installation directory.

1. Navigate to the manifests directory:

```terminal
$ cd <path_to_installation_directory>/manifests
```

2. Create the cloud-conf ConfigMap file with the name openshift-cloud-controller-manager-cloud-config.yaml and add the following information:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cloud-conf
  namespace: openshift-cloud-controller-manager
data:
  cloud.conf: "{
      \"prismCentral\": {
          \"address\": \"<prism_central_FQDN/IP>\", 1
          \"port\": 9440,
            \"credentialRef\": {
                \"kind\": \"Secret\",
                \"name\": \"nutanix-credentials\",
                \"namespace\": \"openshift-cloud-controller-manager\"
            }
       },
       \"topologyDiscovery\": {
           \"type\": \"Prism\",
           \"topologyCategories\": null
       },
       \"enableCustomLabeling\": true
     }"
```

Specify the Prism Central FQDN/IP.
3. Verify that the file cluster-infrastructure-02-config.yml exists and has the following information:

```yaml
spec:
  cloudConfig:
    key: config
    name: cloud-provider-config
```


# Deploying the cluster

You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a compatible cloud platform.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can run the create cluster command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
----

* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
* You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.

* Change to the directory that contains the installation program and initialize the cluster deployment:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \ 1
    --log-level=info 2
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the
location of your customized ./install-config.yaml file.
To view different installation details, specify warn, debug, or
error instead of info.

When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

* The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the kubeadmin user.
* Credential information also outputs to <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
----


```terminal
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
* The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.
* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
----

# Configuring the default storage container

After you install the cluster, you must install the Nutanix CSI Operator and configure the default storage container for the cluster.

For more information, see the Nutanix documentation for installing the CSI Operator and configuring registry storage.

# Telemetry access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, the Telemetry service, which runs by default to provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, requires internet access. If your cluster is connected to the internet, Telemetry runs automatically, and your cluster is registered to https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager].

After you confirm that your https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] inventory is correct, either maintained automatically by Telemetry or manually by using OpenShift Cluster Manager, use subscription watch to track your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscriptions at the account or multi-cluster level.
