# Installing the Compliance Operator


Before you can use the Compliance Operator, you must ensure it is deployed in the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The Compliance Operator might report incorrect results on managed platforms, such as OpenShift Dedicated, Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS, and Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift. For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase Solution #6983418.

# Installing the Compliance Operator through the web console

* You must have admin privileges.

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to Operators -> OperatorHub.
2. Search for the Compliance Operator, then click Install.
3. Keep the default selection of Installation mode and namespace to ensure that the Operator will be installed to the openshift-compliance namespace.
4. Click Install.

To confirm that the installation is successful:

1. Navigate to the Operators -> Installed Operators page.
2. Check that the Compliance Operator is installed in the openshift-compliance namespace and its status is Succeeded.

If the Operator is not installed successfully:

1. Navigate to the Operators -> Installed Operators page and inspect the Status column for any errors or failures.
2. Navigate to the Workloads -> Pods page and check the logs in any pods in the openshift-compliance project that are reporting issues.


[IMPORTANT]
----
If the restricted Security Context Constraints (SCC) have been modified to contain the system:authenticated group or has added requiredDropCapabilities, the Compliance Operator may not function properly due to permissions issues.
You can create a custom SCC for the Compliance Operator scanner pod service account. For more information, see Creating a custom SCC for the Compliance Operator.

# Installing the Compliance Operator using the CLI

* You must have admin privileges.

1. Define a Namespace object:
Example namespace-object.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged 1
  name: openshift-compliance
```

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, the pod security label must be set to privileged at the namespace level.
2. Create the Namespace object:

```terminal
$ oc create -f namespace-object.yaml
```

3. Define an OperatorGroup object:
Example operator-group-object.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: compliance-operator
  namespace: openshift-compliance
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - openshift-compliance
```

4. Create the OperatorGroup object:

```terminal
$ oc create -f operator-group-object.yaml
```

5. Define a Subscription object:
Example subscription-object.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: compliance-operator-sub
  namespace: openshift-compliance
spec:
  channel: "stable"
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: compliance-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
```

6. Create the Subscription object:

```terminal
$ oc create -f subscription-object.yaml
```



[NOTE]
----
If you are setting the global scheduler feature and enable defaultNodeSelector, you must create the namespace manually and update the annotations of the openshift-compliance namespace, or the namespace where the Compliance Operator was installed, with openshift.io/node-selector: “”. This removes the default node selector and prevents deployment failures.
----

1. Verify the installation succeeded by inspecting the CSV file:

```terminal
$ oc get csv -n openshift-compliance
```

2. Verify that the Compliance Operator is up and running:

```terminal
$ oc get deploy -n openshift-compliance
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
If the restricted Security Context Constraints (SCC) have been modified to contain the system:authenticated group or has added requiredDropCapabilities, the Compliance Operator may not function properly due to permissions issues.
You can create a custom SCC for the Compliance Operator scanner pod service account. For more information, see Creating a custom SCC for the Compliance Operator.

# Installing the Compliance Operator on hosted control planes

The Compliance Operator can be installed in hosted control planes using the OperatorHub by creating a Subscription file.

* You must have admin privileges.

1. Define a Namespace object similar to the following:
Example namespace-object.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged 1
  name: openshift-compliance
```

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, the pod security label must be set to privileged at the namespace level.
2. Create the Namespace object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f namespace-object.yaml
```

3. Define an OperatorGroup object:
Example operator-group-object.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: compliance-operator
  namespace: openshift-compliance
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - openshift-compliance
```

4. Create the OperatorGroup object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f operator-group-object.yaml
```

5. Define a Subscription object:
Example subscription-object.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: compliance-operator-sub
  namespace: openshift-compliance
spec:
  channel: "stable"
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: compliance-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  config:
    nodeSelector:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
    env:
    - name: PLATFORM
      value: "HyperShift"
```

6. Create the Subscription object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f subscription-object.yaml
```


1. Verify the installation succeeded by inspecting the CSV file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get csv -n openshift-compliance
```

2. Verify that the Compliance Operator is up and running by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get deploy -n openshift-compliance
```
