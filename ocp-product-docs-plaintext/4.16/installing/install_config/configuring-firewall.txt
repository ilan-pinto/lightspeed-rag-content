# Configuring your firewall


If you use a firewall, you must configure it so that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can access the sites that it requires to function. You must always grant access to some sites, and you grant access to more if you use
Red Hat Insights, the Telemetry service, a cloud to host your cluster, and certain build strategies.

# Configuring your firewall for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must configure your firewall to grant access to the sites that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform requires. When using a firewall, make additional configurations to the firewall so that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can access the sites that it requires to function.

There are no special configuration considerations for services running on only controller nodes compared to worker nodes.


[NOTE]
----
If your environment has a dedicated load balancer in front of your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, review the allowlists between your firewall and load balancer to prevent unwanted network restrictions to your cluster.

1. Set the following registry URLs for your firewall's allowlist:

1. In a firewall environment, ensure that the access.redhat.com resource is on the allowlist. This resource hosts a signature store that a container client requires for verifying images when pulling them from registry.access.redhat.com.

You can use the wildcards *.quay.io and *.openshiftapps.com instead of cdn.quay.io and cdn0[1-3].quay.io in your allowlist. When you add a site, such as quay.io, to your allowlist, do not add a wildcard entry, such as *.quay.io, to your denylist. In most cases, image registries use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve images. If a firewall blocks access, image downloads are denied when the initial download request redirects to a hostname such as cdn01.quay.io.
2. Set your firewall's allowlist to include any site that provides resources for a language or framework that your builds require.
3. If you do not disable Telemetry, you must grant access to the following URLs to access Red Hat Insights:

4. If you use Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your cluster, you must grant access to the URLs that offer the cloud provider API and DNS for that cloud:

5. Allowlist the following URLs:


Operators require route access to perform health checks. Specifically, the
authentication and web console Operators connect to two routes to verify that
the routes work. If you are the cluster administrator and do not want to allow
*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>, then allow these routes:
* oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
* console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>, or the hostname
that is specified in the spec.route.hostname field of the
consoles.operator/cluster object if the field is not empty.
6. Allowlist the following URLs for optional third-party content:

7. If you use a default Red Hat Network Time Protocol (NTP) server allow the following URLs:
* 1.rhel.pool.ntp.org
* 2.rhel.pool.ntp.org
* 3.rhel.pool.ntp.org


[NOTE]
----
If you do not use a default Red Hat NTP server, verify the NTP server for your platform and allow it in your firewall.
