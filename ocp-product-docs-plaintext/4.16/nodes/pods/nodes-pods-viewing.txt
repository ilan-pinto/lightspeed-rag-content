# Viewing pods


As an administrator, you can view the pods in your cluster and to determine the health of those pods and the cluster as a whole.

# About pods

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform leverages the Kubernetes concept of a pod, which is one or more containers deployed
together on one host, and the smallest compute unit that can be defined,
deployed, and managed. Pods are the rough equivalent of a machine instance (physical or virtual) to a container.

You can view a list of pods associated with a specific project or view usage statistics about pods.

# Viewing pods in a project

You can view a list of pods associated with the current project, including the number of replica, the current status, number or restarts and the age of the pod.

To view the pods in a project:

1. Change to the project:

```terminal
$ oc project <project-name>
```

2. Run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods
```


For example:

```terminal
$ oc get pods
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
console-698d866b78-bnshf   1/1     Running   2          165m
console-698d866b78-m87pm   1/1     Running   2          165m
```


Add the -o wide flags to view the pod IP address and the node where the pod is located.

```terminal
$ oc get pods -o wide
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE    IP            NODE                           NOMINATED NODE
console-698d866b78-bnshf   1/1     Running   2          166m   10.128.0.24   ip-10-0-152-71.ec2.internal    <none>
console-698d866b78-m87pm   1/1     Running   2          166m   10.129.0.23   ip-10-0-173-237.ec2.internal   <none>
```


# Viewing pod usage statistics

You can display usage statistics about pods, which provide the runtime
environments for containers. These usage statistics include CPU, memory, and
storage consumption.

* You must have cluster-reader permission to view the usage statistics.
* Metrics must be installed to view the usage statistics.

To view the usage statistics:

1. Run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm top pods
```


For example:

```terminal
$ oc adm top pods -n openshift-console
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                         CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)
console-7f58c69899-q8c8k     0m           22Mi
console-7f58c69899-xhbgg     0m           25Mi
downloads-594fcccf94-bcxk8   3m           18Mi
downloads-594fcccf94-kv4p6   2m           15Mi
```

2. Run the following command to view the usage statistics for pods with labels:

```terminal
$ oc adm top pod --selector=''
```


You must choose the selector (label query) to filter on. Supports =, ==, and !=.

For example:

```terminal
$ oc adm top pod --selector='name=my-pod'
```


# Viewing resource logs

You can view the log for various resources in the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) and web console. Logs read from the tail, or end, of the log.

* Access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console, navigate to Workloads -> Pods or navigate to the pod through the resource you want to investigate.

[NOTE]
----
Some resources, such as builds, do not have pods to query directly. In such instances, you can locate the Logs link on the Details page for the resource.
----
2. Select a project from the drop-down menu.
3. Click the name of the pod you want to investigate.
4. Click Logs.

* View the log for a specific pod:

```terminal
$ oc logs -f <pod_name> -c <container_name>
```

where:
-f:: Optional: Specifies that the output follows what is being written into the logs.
<pod_name>:: Specifies the name of the pod.
<container_name>:: Optional: Specifies the name of a container. When a pod has more than one container, you must specify the container name.

For example:

```terminal
$ oc logs ruby-58cd97df55-mww7r
```


```terminal
$ oc logs -f ruby-57f7f4855b-znl92 -c ruby
```


The contents of log files are printed out.
* View the log for a specific resource:

```terminal
$ oc logs <object_type>/<resource_name> 1
```

Specifies the resource type and name.

For example:

```terminal
$ oc logs deployment/ruby
```


The contents of log files are printed out.
