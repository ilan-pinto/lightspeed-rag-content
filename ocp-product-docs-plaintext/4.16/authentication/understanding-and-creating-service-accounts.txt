# Understanding and creating service accounts



# Service accounts overview

A service account is an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform account that allows a component to
directly access the API. Service accounts are API objects that exist within each project.
Service accounts provide a flexible way to control API
access without sharing a regular user&#8217;s credentials.

When you use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI or web console, your API token
authenticates you to the API. You can associate a component with a service account
so that they can access the API without using a regular user&#8217;s credentials.

Each service account&#8217;s user name is derived from its project and name:


```text
system:serviceaccount:<project>:<name>
```


Every service account is also a member of two groups:



Each service account automatically contains two secrets:

* An API token
* Credentials for the OpenShift Container Registry

The generated API token and registry credentials do not expire, but you can
revoke them by deleting the secret. When you delete the secret, a new one is
automatically generated to take its place.

# Creating service accounts

You can create a service account in a project and grant it permissions by
binding it to a role.

1. Optional: To view the service accounts in the current project:

```terminal
$ oc get sa
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME       SECRETS   AGE
builder    2         2d
default    2         2d
deployer   2         2d
```

2. To create a new service account in the current project:

```terminal
$ oc create sa <service_account_name> 1
```

To create a service account in a different project, specify -n <project_name>.
Example output

```terminal
serviceaccount "robot" created
```


[TIP]
----
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to create the service account:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: <service_account_name>
  namespace: <current_project>
```

----
3. Optional: View the secrets for the service account:

```terminal
$ oc describe sa robot
```

Example output

```terminal
Name:                robot
Namespace:           project1
Labels:	             <none>
Annotations:	     <none>
Image pull secrets:  robot-dockercfg-qzbhb
Mountable secrets:   robot-dockercfg-qzbhb
Tokens:              robot-token-f4khf
Events:              <none>
```


# Examples of granting roles to service accounts

You can grant roles to service accounts in the same way that you grant roles
to a regular user account.

* You can modify the service accounts for the current project. For example, to add
the view role to the robot service account in the top-secret project:

```terminal
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:top-secret:robot
```


[TIP]
----
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the role:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: view
  namespace: top-secret
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: view
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: robot
  namespace: top-secret
```

----
* You can also grant access to a specific service account in a project. For
example, from the project to which the service account belongs, use
the -z flag and specify the <service_account_name>

```terminal
$ oc policy add-role-to-user <role_name> -z <service_account_name>
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
If you want to grant access to a specific service account in a project, use the
-z flag. Using this flag helps prevent typos and ensures that access
is granted to only the specified service account.

[TIP]
----
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the role:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: <rolebinding_name>
  namespace: <current_project_name>
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: <role_name>
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: <service_account_name>
  namespace: <current_project_name>
```

----
* To modify a different namespace, you can use the -n option to indicate the
project namespace it applies to, as shown in the following examples.
* For example, to allow all service accounts in all projects to view resources in
the my-project project:

```terminal
$ oc policy add-role-to-group view system:serviceaccounts -n my-project
```


[TIP]

You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the role:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: view
  namespace: my-project
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: view
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Group
  name: system:serviceaccounts
```

----
* To allow all service accounts in the managers project to edit resources in the
my-project project:

```terminal
$ oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccounts:managers -n my-project
```


[TIP]
----
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the role:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: edit
  namespace: my-project
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: edit
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Group
  name: system:serviceaccounts:managers
```
