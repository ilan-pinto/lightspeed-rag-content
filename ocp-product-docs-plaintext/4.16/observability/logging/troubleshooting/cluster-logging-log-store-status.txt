# Viewing the status of the Elasticsearch log store


You can view the status of the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator and for a number of Elasticsearch components.

# Viewing the status of the Elasticsearch log store

You can view the status of the Elasticsearch log store.

* The Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator and OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator are installed.

1. Change to the openshift-logging project by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc project openshift-logging
```

2. To view the status:
1. Get the name of the Elasticsearch log store instance by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get Elasticsearch
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME            AGE
elasticsearch   5h9m
```

2. Get the Elasticsearch log store status by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get Elasticsearch <Elasticsearch-instance> -o yaml
```


For example:

```terminal
$ oc get Elasticsearch elasticsearch -n openshift-logging -o yaml
```


The output includes information similar to the following:
Example output

```yaml

  cluster: 2
    activePrimaryShards: 30
    activeShards: 60
    initializingShards: 0
    numDataNodes: 3

      - elasticsearch-cdm-zjf34ved-3-c8f566f7c-t7zkt
  shardAllocationEnabled: all
```

In the output, the cluster status fields appear in the status stanza.
The status of the Elasticsearch log store:
* The number of active primary shards.
* The number of active shards.
* The number of shards that are initializing.
* The number of Elasticsearch log store data nodes.
* The total number of Elasticsearch log store nodes.
* The number of pending tasks.
* The Elasticsearch log store status: green, red, yellow.
* The number of unassigned shards.
Any status conditions, if present. The Elasticsearch log store status indicates the reasons from the scheduler if a pod could not be placed. Any events related to the following conditions are shown:
* Container Waiting for both the Elasticsearch log store and proxy containers.
* Container Terminated for both the Elasticsearch log store and proxy containers.
* Pod unschedulable.
Also, a condition is shown for a number of issues; see Example condition messages.
The Elasticsearch log store nodes in the cluster, with upgradeStatus.
The Elasticsearch log store client, data, and master pods in the cluster, listed under failed, notReady, or ready state.

## Example condition messages

The following are examples of some condition messages from the Status section of the Elasticsearch instance.

The following status message indicates that a node has exceeded the configured low watermark, and no shard will be allocated to this node.


```yaml
status:
  nodes:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2019-03-15T15:57:22Z
      message: Disk storage usage for node is 27.5gb (36.74%). Shards will be not
        be allocated on this node.
      reason: Disk Watermark Low
      status: "True"
      type: NodeStorage
    deploymentName: example-elasticsearch-cdm-0-1
    upgradeStatus: {}
```


The following status message indicates that a node has exceeded the configured high watermark, and shards will be relocated to other nodes.


```yaml
status:
  nodes:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2019-03-15T16:04:45Z
      message: Disk storage usage for node is 27.5gb (36.74%). Shards will be relocated
        from this node.
      reason: Disk Watermark High
      status: "True"
      type: NodeStorage
    deploymentName: example-elasticsearch-cdm-0-1
    upgradeStatus: {}
```


The following status message indicates that the Elasticsearch log store node selector in the custom resource (CR) does not match any nodes in the cluster:


```yaml
status:
    nodes:
    - conditions:
      - lastTransitionTime: 2019-04-10T02:26:24Z
        message: '0/8 nodes are available: 8 node(s) didn''t match node selector.'
        reason: Unschedulable
        status: "True"
        type: Unschedulable
```


The following status message indicates that the Elasticsearch log store CR uses a non-existent persistent volume claim (PVC).


```yaml
status:
   nodes:
   - conditions:
     - last Transition Time:  2019-04-10T05:55:51Z
       message:               pod has unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims (repeated 5 times)
       reason:                Unschedulable
       status:                True
       type:                  Unschedulable
```


The following status message indicates that your Elasticsearch log store cluster does not have enough nodes to support the redundancy policy.


```yaml
status:
  clusterHealth: ""
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: 2019-04-17T20:01:31Z
    message: Wrong RedundancyPolicy selected. Choose different RedundancyPolicy or
      add more nodes with data roles
    reason: Invalid Settings
    status: "True"
    type: InvalidRedundancy
```


This status message indicates your cluster has too many control plane nodes:


```yaml
status:
  clusterHealth: green
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: '2019-04-17T20:12:34Z'
      message: >-
        Invalid master nodes count. Please ensure there are no more than 3 total
        nodes with master roles
      reason: Invalid Settings
      status: 'True'
      type: InvalidMasters
```


The following status message indicates that Elasticsearch storage does not support the change you tried to make.

For example:


```yaml
status:
  clusterHealth: green
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2021-05-07T01:05:13Z"
      message: Changing the storage structure for a custom resource is not supported
      reason: StorageStructureChangeIgnored
      status: 'True'
      type: StorageStructureChangeIgnored
```


The reason and type fields specify the type of unsupported change:

StorageClassNameChangeIgnored:: Unsupported change to the storage class name.
StorageSizeChangeIgnored:: Unsupported change the storage size.
StorageStructureChangeIgnored:: Unsupported change between ephemeral and persistent storage structures.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you try to configure the ClusterLogging CR to switch from ephemeral to persistent storage, the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator creates a persistent volume claim (PVC) but does not create a persistent volume (PV). To clear the StorageStructureChangeIgnored status, you must revert the change to the ClusterLogging CR and delete the PVC.
----

# Viewing the status of the log store components

You can view the status for a number of the log store components.

Elasticsearch indices:: You can view the status of the Elasticsearch indices.
1. Get the name of an Elasticsearch pod:

```terminal

# Elasticsearch cluster status

A dashboard in the Observe section of the
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console
displays the status of the Elasticsearch cluster.

To get the status of the OpenShift Elasticsearch cluster, visit the dashboard in the Observe section of the
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console
at
<cluster_url>/monitoring/dashboards/grafana-dashboard-cluster-logging.

eo_elasticsearch_cr_cluster_management_state:: Shows whether the Elasticsearch cluster is in a managed or unmanaged state. For example:

```terminal
eo_elasticsearch_cr_cluster_management_state{state="managed"} 1
eo_elasticsearch_cr_cluster_management_state{state="unmanaged"} 0
```

eo_elasticsearch_cr_restart_total:: Shows the number of times the Elasticsearch nodes have restarted for certificate restarts, rolling restarts, or scheduled restarts. For example:

```terminal
eo_elasticsearch_cr_restart_total{reason="cert_restart"} 1
eo_elasticsearch_cr_restart_total{reason="rolling_restart"} 1
eo_elasticsearch_cr_restart_total{reason="scheduled_restart"} 3
```

es_index_namespaces_total:: Shows the total number of Elasticsearch index namespaces. For example:

```terminal
Total number of Namespaces.
es_index_namespaces_total 5
```

es_index_document_count:: Shows the number of records for each namespace. For example:

```terminal
es_index_document_count{namespace="namespace_1"} 25
es_index_document_count{namespace="namespace_2"} 10
es_index_document_count{namespace="namespace_3"} 5
```


If Elasticsearch is missing the admin-cert, admin-key, logging-es.crt, or logging-es.key files, the dashboard shows a status message similar to the following example:


```terminal
message": "Secret \"elasticsearch\" fields are either missing or empty: [admin-cert, admin-key, logging-es.crt, logging-es.key]",
"reason": "Missing Required Secrets",
```
