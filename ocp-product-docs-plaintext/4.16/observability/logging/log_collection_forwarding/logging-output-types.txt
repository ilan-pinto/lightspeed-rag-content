# Log output types


Outputs define the destination where logs are sent to from a log forwarder. You can configure multiple types of outputs in the ClusterLogForwarder custom resource (CR) to send logs to servers that support different protocols.

# Supported log forwarding outputs

Outputs can be any of the following types:



1. Fluentd does not support Elasticsearch 8 in the logging version 5.6.2.
2. Vector supports Syslog in the logging version 5.7 and higher.

# Output type descriptions

default:: The on-cluster, Red Hat managed log store. You are not required to configure the default output.

[NOTE]
----
If you configure a default output, you receive an error message, because the default output name is reserved for referencing the on-cluster, Red Hat managed log store.
----
loki:: Loki, a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system.
kafka:: A Kafka broker. The kafka output can use a TCP or TLS connection.
elasticsearch:: An external Elasticsearch instance. The elasticsearch output can use a TLS connection.
fluentdForward:: An external log aggregation solution that supports Fluentd. This option uses the Fluentd forward protocols. The fluentForward output can use a TCP or TLS connection and supports shared-key authentication by providing a shared_key field in a secret. Shared-key authentication can be used with or without TLS.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The fluentdForward output is only supported if you are using the Fluentd collector. It is not supported if you are using the Vector collector. If you are using the Vector collector, you can forward logs to Fluentd by using the http output.
----
syslog:: An external log aggregation solution that supports the syslog RFC3164 or RFC5424 protocols. The syslog output can use a UDP, TCP, or TLS connection.
cloudwatch:: Amazon CloudWatch, a monitoring and log storage service hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
cloudlogging:: Google Cloud Logging, a monitoring and log storage service hosted by Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
