# Uninstalling Logging


You can remove logging from your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster by removing installed Operators and related custom resources (CRs).

# Uninstalling the logging

You can stop aggregating logs by deleting the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator and the ClusterLogging custom resource (CR).

* You have administrator permissions.
* You have access to the Administrator perspective of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

1. Go to the Administration -> Custom Resource Definitions page, and click ClusterLogging.
2. On the Custom Resource Definition Details page, click Instances.
3. Click the options menu . next to the instance, and click Delete ClusterLogging.
4. Go to the Administration -> Custom Resource Definitions page.
5. Click the options menu . next to ClusterLogging, and select Delete Custom Resource Definition.

[WARNING]
----
Deleting the ClusterLogging CR does not remove the persistent volume claims (PVCs). To delete the remaining PVCs, persistent volumes (PVs), and associated data, you must take further action. Releasing or deleting PVCs can delete PVs and cause data loss.
----
6. If you have created a ClusterLogForwarder CR, click the options menu . next to ClusterLogForwarder, and then click Delete Custom Resource Definition.
7. Go to the Operators -> Installed Operators page.
8. Click the options menu . next to the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator, and then click Uninstall Operator.
9. Optional: Delete the openshift-logging project.

[WARNING]
----
Deleting the openshift-logging project deletes everything in that namespace, including any persistent volume claims (PVCs). If you want to preserve logging data, do not delete the openshift-logging project.

1. Go to the Home -> Projects page.
2. Click the options menu . next to the openshift-logging project, and then click Delete Project.
3. Confirm the deletion by typing openshift-logging in the dialog box, and then click Delete.

# Deleting logging PVCs

To keep persistent volume claims (PVCs) for reuse with other pods, keep the labels or PVC names that you need to reclaim the PVCs.
If you do not want to keep the PVCs, you can delete them. If you want to recover storage space, you can also delete the persistent volumes (PVs).

* You have administrator permissions.
* You have access to the Administrator perspective of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

1. Go to the Storage -> Persistent Volume Claims page.
2. Click the options menu . next to each PVC, and select Delete Persistent Volume Claim.

# Uninstalling Loki

* You have administrator permissions.
* You have access to the Administrator perspective of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
* If you have not already removed the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator and related resources, you have removed references to LokiStack from the ClusterLogging custom resource.

1. Go to the Administration -> Custom Resource Definitions page, and click LokiStack.
2. On the Custom Resource Definition Details page, click Instances.
3. Click the options menu . next to the instance, and then click Delete LokiStack.

# Uninstalling Elasticsearch

# Deleting Operators from a cluster using the CLI

Cluster administrators can delete installed Operators from a selected namespace by using the CLI.

* You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with
* The OpenShift CLI (oc) is installed on your workstation.

1. Ensure the latest version of the subscribed operator (for example, serverless-operator) is identified in the currentCSV field.

```terminal
$ oc get subscription.operators.coreos.com serverless-operator -n openshift-serverless -o yaml | grep currentCSV
```

Example output

```terminal
  currentCSV: serverless-operator.v1.28.0
```

2. Delete the subscription (for example, serverless-operator):

```terminal
$ oc delete subscription.operators.coreos.com serverless-operator -n openshift-serverless
```

Example output

```terminal
subscription.operators.coreos.com "serverless-operator" deleted
```

3. Delete the CSV for the Operator in the target namespace using the currentCSV value from the previous step:

```terminal
$ oc delete clusterserviceversion serverless-operator.v1.28.0 -n openshift-serverless
```

Example output

```terminal
clusterserviceversion.operators.coreos.com "serverless-operator.v1.28.0" deleted
```
