# Configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector metrics

You can enable metrics and alerts of OpenTelemetry Collector instances.

* Monitoring for user-defined projects is enabled in the cluster.

* To enable metrics of an OpenTelemetry Collector instance, set the spec.observability.metrics.enableMetrics field to true:

```yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
metadata:
  name: <name>
spec:
  observability:
    metrics:
      enableMetrics: true
```


You can use the Administrator view of the web console to verify successful configuration:

* Go to Observe -> Targets, filter by Source: User, and check that the ServiceMonitors in the opentelemetry-collector-<instance_name> format have the Up status.

* Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects
