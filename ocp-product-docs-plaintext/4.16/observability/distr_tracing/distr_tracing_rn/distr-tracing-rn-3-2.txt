# Release notes for Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 3.2



# Distributed tracing overview

As a service owner, you can use distributed tracing to instrument your services to gather insights into your service architecture.
You can use the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform for monitoring, network profiling, and troubleshooting the interaction between components in modern, cloud-native, microservices-based applications.

With the distributed tracing platform, you can perform the following functions:

* Monitor distributed transactions
* Optimize performance and latency
* Perform root cause analysis

You can use the distributed tracing platform in combination with the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry.

This release of the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform includes the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo) and the deprecated Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger).

# Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo)

The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo) is provided through the Tempo Operator.

## New features and enhancements

This update introduces the following enhancements:

* Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo) 3.2 is based on the open source Grafana Tempo 2.4.1.
* Allowing the overriding of resources per component.

## Bug fixes

This update introduces the following bug fixes:

* Before this update, the Jaeger UI only displayed services that sent traces in the previous 15 minutes. With this update, the availability of the service and operation names can be configured by using the following field: spec.template.queryFrontend.jaegerQuery.servicesQueryDuration. (TRACING-3139)
* Before this update, the query-frontend pod might get stopped when out-of-memory (OOM) as a result of searching a large trace. With this update, resource limits can be set to prevent this issue. (TRACING-4009)

## Known issues

There is currently a known issue:

* Currently, the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) fails on the IBM Z (s390x) architecture. (TRACING-3545)

# Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger)

The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) is provided through the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operator.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Jaeger does not use FIPS validated cryptographic modules.

## Support for OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) 3.2 is supported for use with the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator 5.6, 5.7, and 5.8.

## Deprecated functionality

In the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 3.2, Jaeger and support for Elasticsearch remain deprecated, and both are planned to be removed in a future release.
Red Hat will provide support for these components and fixes for CVEs and bugs with critical and higher severity during the current release lifecycle, but these components will no longer receive feature enhancements.
The Tempo Operator and the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry are the preferred Operators for distributed tracing collection and storage.
Users must adopt the OpenTelemetry and Tempo distributed tracing stack because it is the stack to be enhanced going forward.

In the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 3.2, the Jaeger agent is deprecated and planned to be removed in the following release.
Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for the Jaeger agent during the current release lifecycle, but the Jaeger agent will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed.
The OpenTelemetry Collector provided by the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry is the preferred Operator for injecting the trace collector agent.

## New features and enhancements

This update introduces the following enhancements for the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger):

* Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) 3.2 is based on the open source Jaeger release 1.57.0.

## Known issues

There is currently a known issue:

* Currently, Apache Spark is not supported.
* Currently, the streaming deployment via AMQ/Kafka is not supported on the IBM Z and IBM Power architectures.

# Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see our CTO Chris Wright's message.
