# Getting started with dynamic plugins


To get started using the dynamic plugin, you must set up your environment to write a new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform dynamic plugin. For an example of how to write a new plugin, see Adding a tab to the pods page.

# Dynamic plugin development

You can run the plugin using a local development environment. The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console runs in a container connected to the cluster you have logged into.

* You must have an OpenShift cluster running.
* You must have the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed.
* You must have yarn installed.
* You must have Docker v3.2.0 or newer or Podman installed and running.

1. In your terminal, run the following command to install the dependencies for your plugin using yarn.

```terminal
$ yarn install
```

2. After installing, run the following command to start yarn.

```terminal
$ yarn run start
```

3. In another terminal window, login to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform through the CLI.

```terminal
$ oc login
```

4. Run the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console in a container connected to the cluster you have logged into by running the following command:

```terminal
$ yarn run start-console
```


* Visit localhost:9000 to view the running plugin. Inspect the value of window.SERVER_FLAGS.consolePlugins to see the list of plugins which load at runtime.
