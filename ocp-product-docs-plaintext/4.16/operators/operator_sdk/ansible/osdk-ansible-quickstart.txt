# Getting started with Operator SDK for Ansible-based Operators


The Operator SDK includes options for generating an Operator project that leverages existing Ansible playbooks and modules to deploy Kubernetes resources as a unified application, without having to write any Go code.
To demonstrate the basics of setting up and running an Ansible-based Operator using tools and libraries provided by the Operator SDK, Operator developers can build an example Ansible-based Operator for Memcached, a distributed key-value store, and deploy it to a cluster.

# Prerequisites

* Operator SDK CLI installed
* OpenShift CLI (oc) 4.16+ installed
* Ansible 2.15.0
* Ansible Runner 2.3.3+
* Ansible Runner HTTP Event Emitter plugin 1.0.0+
* Python 3.9+
* Python Kubernetes client
* Logged into an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 cluster with oc with an account that has cluster-admin permissions
* To allow the cluster to pull the image, the repository where you push your image must be set as public, or you must configure an image pull secret

* Installing the Operator SDK CLI
* Getting started with the OpenShift CLI

# Creating and deploying Ansible-based Operators

You can build and deploy a simple {type}-based Operator for {app-proper} by using the Operator SDK.

1. Create a project.
1. Create your project directory:

```terminal
$ mkdir {app}-operator
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```terminal
$ cd {app}-operator
```

3. Run the operator-sdk init command
with the ansible plugin
to initialize the project:

```terminal
$ operator-sdk init \
    --plugins=ansible \
    --domain=example.com
```

2. Create an API.

Create a simple {app-proper} API:

```terminal
$ operator-sdk create api \
    --group {group} \
    --version v1 \
    --kind {app-proper} \
    --generate-role 1
```

Generates an Ansible role for the API.
3. Build and push the Operator image.

Use the default Makefile targets to build and push your Operator. Set IMG with a pull spec for your image that uses a registry you can push to:

```terminal
$ make docker-build docker-push IMG=<registry>/<user>/<image_name>:<tag>
```

4. Run the Operator.
1. Install the CRD:

```terminal
$ make install
```

2. Deploy the project to the cluster. Set IMG to the image that you pushed:

```terminal
$ make deploy IMG=<registry>/<user>/<image_name>:<tag>
```

5. Create a sample custom resource (CR).
1. Create a sample CR:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f config/samples/{group}_v1_{app}.yaml \
    -n {app}-operator-system
```

2. Watch for the CR to reconcile the Operator:

```terminal
$ oc logs deployment.apps/{app}-operator-controller-manager \
    -c manager \
    -n {app}-operator-system
```

Example output

```terminal

```

6. Delete a CR.

Delete a CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete -f config/samples/{group}_v1_{app}.yaml -n {app}-operator-system
```

7. Clean up.

Run the following command to clean up the resources that have been created as part of this procedure:

```terminal
$ make undeploy
```
