# Monitoring cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift


You can expose controller metrics for the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift in the format provided by the Prometheus Operator.

# Enabling monitoring by using a service monitor for the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift

You can enable monitoring and metrics collection for the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift by using a service monitor to perform the custom metrics scraping.

* You have access to the cluster with cluster-admin privileges.
* The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift is installed.

1. Add the label to enable cluster monitoring by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc label namespace cert-manager openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true
```

2. Create a service monitor:
1. Create a YAML file that defines the Role, RoleBinding, and ServiceMonitor objects:
Example monitoring.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: prometheus-k8s
  namespace: cert-manager
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - services
  - endpoints
  - pods
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: prometheus-k8s
  namespace: cert-manager
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: prometheus-k8s
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: prometheus-k8s
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
---
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    app: cert-manager
    app.kubernetes.io/component: controller
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: cert-manager
    app.kubernetes.io/name: cert-manager
  name: cert-manager
  namespace: cert-manager
spec:
  endpoints:
  - interval: 30s
    port: tcp-prometheus-servicemonitor
    scheme: http
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/component: controller
      app.kubernetes.io/instance: cert-manager
      app.kubernetes.io/name: cert-manager
```

2. Create the Role, RoleBinding, and ServiceMonitor objects by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f monitoring.yaml
```


* Setting up metrics collection for user-defined projects

# Querying metrics for the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift

After you have enabled monitoring for the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift, you can query its metrics by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.
* You have enabled monitoring and metrics collection for the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.

1. From the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to Observe -> Metrics.
2. Add a query by using one of the following formats:
* Specify the endpoints:

```promql
{instance="<endpoint>"} 1
```

Replace <endpoint> with the value of the endpoint for the cert-manager service. You can find the endpoint value by running the following command: oc describe service cert-manager -n cert-manager.
* Specify the tcp-prometheus-servicemonitor port:

```promql
{endpoint="tcp-prometheus-servicemonitor"}
```
