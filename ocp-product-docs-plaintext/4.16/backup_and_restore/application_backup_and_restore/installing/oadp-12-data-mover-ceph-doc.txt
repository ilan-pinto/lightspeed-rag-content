# Using OADP 1.2 Data Mover with Ceph storage


You can use OADP 1.2 Data Mover to back up and restore application data for clusters that use CephFS, CephRBD, or both.
OADP 1.2 Data Mover leverages Ceph features that support large-scale environments. One of these is the shallow copy method, which is available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later. This feature supports backing up and restoring StorageClass and AccessMode resources other than what is found on the source persistent volume claim (PVC).

[IMPORTANT]
----
The CephFS shallow copy feature is a backup feature. It is not part of restore operations.
----

# Prerequisites for using OADP 1.2 Data Mover with Ceph storage

The following prerequisites apply to all back up and restore operations of data using OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover in a cluster that uses Ceph storage:

* You have installed Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 or later.
* You have installed the OADP Operator.
* You have created a secret cloud-credentials in the namespace openshift-adp.
* You have installed Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation.
* You have installed the latest VolSync Operator by using Operator Lifecycle Manager.

# Defining custom resources for use with OADP 1.2 Data Mover

When you install Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, it automatically creates default CephFS and a CephRBD StorageClass and VolumeSnapshotClass custom resources (CRs). You must define these CRs for use with OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover.

After you define the CRs, you must make several other changes to your environment before you can perform your back up and restore operations.

## Defining CephFS custom resources for use with OADP 1.2 Data Mover

When you install Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, it automatically creates a default CephFS StorageClass custom resource (CR) and a default CephFS VolumeSnapshotClass CR. You can define these CRs for use with OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover.

1. Define the VolumeSnapshotClass CR as in the following example:
Example VolumeSnapshotClass CR

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
deletionPolicy: <deletion_policy_type> 1
driver: openshift-storage.cephfs.csi.ceph.com
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
  annotations:
    snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: true 2
  labels:
    velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class: true 3
  name: ocs-storagecluster-cephfsplugin-snapclass
parameters:
  clusterID: openshift-storage
  csi.storage.k8s.io/snapshotter-secret-name: rook-csi-cephfs-provisioner
  csi.storage.k8s.io/snapshotter-secret-namespace: openshift-storage
```

OADP supports the Retain and Delete deletion policy types for CSI and Data Mover backup and restore. For the OADP 1.2 Data Mover, set the deletion policy type to Retain.
Must be set to true.
Must be set to true.
2. Define the StorageClass CR as in the following example:
Example StorageClass CR

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
  annotations:
    description: Provides RWO and RWX Filesystem volumes
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: true 1
provisioner: openshift-storage.cephfs.csi.ceph.com
parameters:
  clusterID: openshift-storage
  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-expand-secret-name: rook-csi-cephfs-provisioner
  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-expand-secret-namespace: openshift-storage
  csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-name: rook-csi-cephfs-node
  csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-namespace: openshift-storage
  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-name: rook-csi-cephfs-provisioner
  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-namespace: openshift-storage
  fsName: ocs-storagecluster-cephfilesystem
reclaimPolicy: Delete
allowVolumeExpansion: true
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
```

Must be set to true.

## Defining CephRBD custom resources for use with OADP 1.2 Data Mover

When you install Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, it automatically creates a default CephRBD StorageClass custom resource (CR) and a default CephRBD VolumeSnapshotClass CR. You can define these CRs for use with OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover.

1. Define the VolumeSnapshotClass CR as in the following example:
Example VolumeSnapshotClass CR

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
deletionPolicy: <deletion_policy_type> 1
driver: openshift-storage.rbd.csi.ceph.com
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
  labels:
    velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class: true 2
  name: ocs-storagecluster-rbdplugin-snapclass
parameters:
  clusterID: openshift-storage
  csi.storage.k8s.io/snapshotter-secret-name: rook-csi-rbd-provisioner
  csi.storage.k8s.io/snapshotter-secret-namespace: openshift-storage
```

OADP supports the Retain and Delete deletion policy types for CSI and Data Mover backup and restore. For the OADP 1.2 Data Mover, set the deletion policy type to Retain.
Must be set to true.
2. Define the StorageClass CR as in the following example:
Example StorageClass CR

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
  annotations:
    description: 'Provides RWO Filesystem volumes, and RWO and RWX Block volumes'
provisioner: openshift-storage.rbd.csi.ceph.com
parameters:
  csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype: ext4
  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-namespace: openshift-storage
  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-name: rook-csi-rbd-provisioner
  csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-name: rook-csi-rbd-node
  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-expand-secret-name: rook-csi-rbd-provisioner
  imageFormat: '2'
  clusterID: openshift-storage
  imageFeatures: layering
  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-expand-secret-namespace: openshift-storage
  pool: ocs-storagecluster-cephblockpool
  csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-namespace: openshift-storage
reclaimPolicy: Delete
allowVolumeExpansion: true
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
```


## Defining additional custom resources for use with OADP 1.2 Data Mover

After you redefine the default StorageClass and CephRBD VolumeSnapshotClass custom resources (CRs), you must create the following CRs:

* A CephFS StorageClass CR defined to use the shallow copy feature
* A Restic Secret CR

1. Create a CephFS StorageClass CR and set the backingSnapshot parameter set to true as in the following example:
Example CephFS StorageClass CR with backingSnapshot set to true

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: ocs-storagecluster-cephfs-shallow
  annotations:
    description: Provides RWO and RWX Filesystem volumes
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: false
provisioner: openshift-storage.cephfs.csi.ceph.com
parameters:
  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-namespace: openshift-storage
  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-name: rook-csi-cephfs-provisioner
  csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-name: rook-csi-cephfs-node
  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-expand-secret-name: rook-csi-cephfs-provisioner
  clusterID: openshift-storage
  fsName: ocs-storagecluster-cephfilesystem
  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-expand-secret-namespace: openshift-storage
  backingSnapshot: true 1
  csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-namespace: openshift-storage
reclaimPolicy: Delete
allowVolumeExpansion: true
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
```

Must be set to true.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Ensure that the CephFS VolumeSnapshotClass and StorageClass CRs have the same value for provisioner.
----
2. Configure a Restic Secret CR as in the following example:
Example Restic Secret CR

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <secret_name>
  namespace: <namespace>
type: Opaque
stringData:
  RESTIC_PASSWORD: <restic_password>
```


# Backing up and restoring data using OADP 1.2 Data Mover and CephFS storage

You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to back up and restore data using CephFS storage by enabling the shallow copy feature of CephFS.

* A stateful application is running in a separate namespace with persistent volume claims (PVCs) using CephFS as the provisioner.
* The StorageClass and VolumeSnapshotClass custom resources (CRs) are defined for CephFS and OADP 1.2 Data Mover.
* There is a secret cloud-credentials in the openshift-adp namespace.

## Creating a DPA for use with CephFS storage

You must create a Data Protection Application (DPA) CR before you use the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to back up and restore data using CephFS storage.

1. For the OADP 1.2 Data Mover, you must verify that the deletionPolicy field of the VolumeSnapshotClass CR is set to Retain by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get volumesnapshotclass -A  -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"Name: "}{.metadata.name}{"  "}{"Retention Policy: "}{.deletionPolicy}{"\n"}{end}'
```

2. Verify that the labels of the VolumeSnapshotClass CR are set to true by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get volumesnapshotclass -A  -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"Name: "}{.metadata.name}{"  "}{"labels: "}{.metadata.labels}{"\n"}{end}'
```

3. Verify that the storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class annotation of the StorageClass CR is set to true by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get storageClass -A  -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"Name: "}{.metadata.name}{"  "}{"annotations: "}{.metadata.annotations}{"\n"}{end}'
```

4. Create a Data Protection Application (DPA) CR similar to the following example:
Example DPA CR

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: velero-sample
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupLocations:
    - velero:
        config:
          profile: default
          region: us-east-1
        credential:
          key: cloud
          name: cloud-credentials
        default: true
        objectStorage:
          bucket: <my_bucket>
          prefix: velero
        provider: aws
  configuration:
      restic:
        enable: false  1
      velero:
        defaultPlugins:
          - openshift
          - aws
          - csi
          - vsm
  features:
      dataMover:
        credentialName: <restic_secret_name> 2
        enable: true 3
        volumeOptionsForStorageClasses: 4
          ocs-storagecluster-cephfs:
            sourceVolumeOptions:
              accessMode: ReadOnlyMany
              cacheAccessMode: ReadWriteMany
              cacheStorageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
              storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-cephfs-shallow
```

There is no default value for the enable field. Valid values are true or false.
Use the Restic Secret that you created when you prepared your environment for working with OADP 1.2 Data Mover and Ceph. If you do not use your Restic Secret, the CR uses the default value dm-credential for this parameter.
There is no default value for the enable field. Valid values are true or false.
Optional parameter. You can define a different set of VolumeOptionsForStorageClass labels for each storageClass volume. This configuration provides a backup for volumes with different providers. The optional VolumeOptionsForStorageClass parameter is typically used with CephFS but can be used for any storage type.

## Backing up data using OADP 1.2 Data Mover and CephFS storage

You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to back up data using CephFS storage by enabling the shallow copy feature of CephFS storage.

1. Create a Backup CR as in the following example:
Example Backup CR

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: <backup_name>
  namespace: <protected_ns>
spec:
  includedNamespaces:
  - <app_ns>
  storageLocation: velero-sample-1
```

2. Monitor the progress of the VolumeSnapshotBackup CRs by completing the following steps:
1. To check the progress of all the VolumeSnapshotBackup CRs, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get vsb -n <app_ns>
```

2. To check the progress of a specific VolumeSnapshotBackup CR, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get vsb <vsb_name> -n <app_ns> -ojsonpath="{.status.phase}`
```

3. Wait several minutes until the VolumeSnapshotBackup CR has the status Completed.
4. Verify that there is at least one snapshot in the object store that is given in the Restic Secret. You can check for this snapshot in your targeted BackupStorageLocation storage provider that has a prefix of /<OADP_namespace>.

## Restoring data using OADP 1.2 Data Mover and CephFS storage

You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to restore data using CephFS storage if the shallow copy feature of CephFS storage was enabled for the back up procedure. The shallow copy feature is not used in the restore procedure.

1. Delete the application namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete vsb -n <app_namespace> --all
```

2. Delete any VolumeSnapshotContent CRs that were created during backup by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete volumesnapshotcontent --all
```

3. Create a Restore CR as in the following example:
Example Restore CR

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: <restore_name>
  namespace: <protected_ns>
spec:
  backupName: <previous_backup_name>
```

4. Monitor the progress of the VolumeSnapshotRestore CRs by doing the following:
1. To check the progress of all the VolumeSnapshotRestore CRs, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get vsr -n <app_ns>
```

2. To check the progress of a specific VolumeSnapshotRestore CR, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get vsr <vsr_name> -n <app_ns> -ojsonpath="{.status.phase}
```

5. Verify that your application data has been restored by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get route <route_name> -n <app_ns> -ojsonpath="{.spec.host}"
```


# Backing up and restoring data using OADP 1.2 Data Mover and split volumes (CephFS and Ceph RBD)

You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to backup and restore data in an environment that has split volumes, that is, an environment that uses both CephFS and CephRBD.

* A stateful application is running in a separate namespace with persistent volume claims (PVCs) using CephFS as the provisioner.
* The StorageClass and VolumeSnapshotClass custom resources (CRs) are defined for CephFS and OADP 1.2 Data Mover.
* There is a secret cloud-credentials in the openshift-adp namespace.

## Creating a DPA for use with split volumes

You must create a Data Protection Application (DPA) CR before you use the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to back up and restore data using split volumes.

* Create a Data Protection Application (DPA) CR as in the following example:
Example DPA CR for environment with split volumes

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: velero-sample
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupLocations:
    - velero:
        config:
          profile: default
          region: us-east-1
        credential:
          key: cloud
          name: cloud-credentials
        default: true
        objectStorage:
          bucket: <my-bucket>
          prefix: velero
        provider: aws
  configuration:
    restic:
      enable: false
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
        - openshift
        - aws
        - csi
        - vsm
  features:
    dataMover:
      credentialName: <restic_secret_name> 1
      enable: true
      volumeOptionsForStorageClasses: 2
        ocs-storagecluster-cephfs:
          sourceVolumeOptions:
            accessMode: ReadOnlyMany
            cacheAccessMode: ReadWriteMany
            cacheStorageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
            storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-cephfs-shallow
        ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd:
          sourceVolumeOptions:
            storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
            cacheStorageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
          destinationVolumeOptions:
            storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
            cacheStorageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
```

Use the Restic Secret that you created when you prepared your environment for working with OADP 1.2 Data Mover and Ceph. If you do not, then the CR will use the default value dm-credential for this parameter.
A different set of VolumeOptionsForStorageClass labels can be defined for each storageClass volume, thus allowing a backup to volumes with different providers. The VolumeOptionsForStorageClass parameter is meant for use with CephFS. However, the optional VolumeOptionsForStorageClass parameter could be used for any storage type.

## Backing up data using OADP 1.2 Data Mover and split volumes

You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to back up data in an environment that has split volumes.

1. Create a Backup CR as in the following example:
Example Backup CR

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: <backup_name>
  namespace: <protected_ns>
spec:
  includedNamespaces:
  - <app_ns>
  storageLocation: velero-sample-1
```

2. Monitor the progress of the VolumeSnapshotBackup CRs by completing the following steps:
1. To check the progress of all the VolumeSnapshotBackup CRs, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get vsb -n <app_ns>
```

2. To check the progress of a specific VolumeSnapshotBackup CR, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get vsb <vsb_name> -n <app_ns> -ojsonpath="{.status.phase}`
```

3. Wait several minutes until the VolumeSnapshotBackup CR has the status Completed.
4. Verify that there is at least one snapshot in the object store that is given in the Restic Secret. You can check for this snapshot in your targeted BackupStorageLocation storage provider that has a prefix of /<OADP_namespace>.

## Restoring data using OADP 1.2 Data Mover and split volumes

You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to restore data in an environment that has split volumes, if the shallow copy feature of CephFS storage was enabled for the back up procedure. The shallow copy feature is not used in the restore procedure.

1. Delete the application namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete vsb -n <app_namespace> --all
```

2. Delete any VolumeSnapshotContent CRs that were created during backup by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete volumesnapshotcontent --all
```

3. Create a Restore CR as in the following example:
Example Restore CR

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: <restore_name>
  namespace: <protected_ns>
spec:
  backupName: <previous_backup_name>
```

4. Monitor the progress of the VolumeSnapshotRestore CRs by doing the following:
1. To check the progress of all the VolumeSnapshotRestore CRs, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get vsr -n <app_ns>
```

2. To check the progress of a specific VolumeSnapshotRestore CR, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get vsr <vsr_name> -n <app_ns> -ojsonpath="{.status.phase}
```

5. Verify that your application data has been restored by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get route <route_name> -n <app_ns> -ojsonpath="{.spec.host}"
```


# Deletion policy for OADP 1.2

The deletion policy determines rules for removing data from a system, specifying when and how deletion occurs based on factors such as retention periods, data sensitivity, and compliance requirements. It manages data removal effectively while meeting regulations and preserving valuable information.

## Deletion policy guidelines for OADP 1.2

Review the following deletion policy guidelines for the OADP 1.2:

* To use OADP 1.2.x Data Mover to backup and restore, set the deletionPolicy field to Retain in the VolumeSnapshotClass custom resource (CR).
* In OADP 1.2.x, to use CSI backup and restore, you can set the deletionPolicy field to either Retain or Delete in the VolumeSnapshotClass CR.


[IMPORTANT]
----
OADP 1.2.x Data Mover to backup and restore is a Technology Preview feature and is not supported without a support exception.
----
