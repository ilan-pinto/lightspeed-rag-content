# Initiating and canceling live migration


You can initiate the live migration of a virtual machine (VM) to another node by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the command line.
You can cancel a live migration by using the web console or the command line. The VM remains on its original node.

[TIP]
----
You can also initiate and cancel live migration by using the virtctl migrate <vm_name> and virtctl migrate-cancel <vm_name> commands.

# Initiating live migration

## Initiating live migration by using the web console

You can live migrate a running virtual machine (VM) to a different node in the cluster by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.


[NOTE]
----
The Migrate action is visible to all users but only cluster administrators can initiate a live migration.
----

* The VM must be migratable.
* If the VM is configured with a host model CPU, the cluster must have an available node that supports the CPU model.

1. Navigate to Virtualization -> VirtualMachines in the web console.
2. Select Migrate from the Options menu . beside a VM.
3. Click Migrate.

## Initiating live migration by using the command line

You can initiate the live migration of a running virtual machine (VM) by using the command line to create a VirtualMachineInstanceMigration object for the VM.

1. Create a VirtualMachineInstanceMigration manifest for the VM that you want to migrate:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachineInstanceMigration
metadata:
  name: <migration_name>
spec:
  vmiName: <vm_name>
```

2. Create the object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <migration_name>.yaml
```


The VirtualMachineInstanceMigration object triggers a live migration of the VM. This object exists in the cluster for as long as the virtual machine instance is running, unless manually deleted.

* Obtain the VM status by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe vmi <vm_name> -n <namespace>
```

Example output

```yaml
# ...
Status:
  Conditions:
    Last Probe Time:       <nil>
    Last Transition Time:  <nil>
    Status:                True
    Type:                  LiveMigratable
  Migration Method:  LiveMigration
  Migration State:

    End Timestamp:                2018-12-24T06:19:42Z
    Migration UID:                d78c8962-0743-11e9-a540-fa163e0c69f1
    Source Node:                  node2.example.com

# Canceling live migration

## Canceling live migration by using the web console

You can cancel the live migration of a virtual machine (VM) by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

1. Navigate to Virtualization -> VirtualMachines in the web console.
2. Select Cancel Migration on the Options menu . beside a VM.

## Canceling live migration by using the command line

Cancel the live migration of a virtual machine by deleting the
VirtualMachineInstanceMigration object associated with the migration.

* Delete the VirtualMachineInstanceMigration object that triggered the live
migration, migration-job in this example:

```terminal
$ oc delete vmim migration-job
```
