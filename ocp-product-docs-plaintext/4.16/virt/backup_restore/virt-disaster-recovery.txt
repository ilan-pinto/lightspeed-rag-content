# Disaster recovery


OpenShift Virtualization supports using disaster recovery (DR) solutions to ensure that your environment can recover after a site outage. To use these methods, you must plan your OpenShift Virtualization deployment in advance.

# About disaster recovery methods

For an overview of disaster recovery (DR) concepts, architecture, and planning considerations, see the Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization disaster recovery guide in the Red Hat Knowledgebase.

The two primary DR methods for OpenShift Virtualization are Metropolitan Disaster Recovery (Metro-DR) and Regional-DR.

Metro-DR:: Metro-DR uses synchronous replication. It writes to storage at both the primary and secondary sites so that the data is always synchronized between sites. Because the storage provider is responsible for ensuring that the synchronization succeeds, the environment must meet the throughput and latency requirements of the storage provider.
Regional-DR:: Regional-DR uses asynchronous replication. The data in the primary site is synchronized with the secondary site at regular intervals. For this type of replication, you can have a higher latency connection between the primary and secondary sites.

## Metro-DR for Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation

OpenShift Virtualization supports the Metro-DR solution for OpenShift Data Foundation, which provides two-way synchronous data replication between managed OpenShift Virtualization clusters installed on primary and secondary sites. This solution combines Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM), Red Hat Ceph Storage, and OpenShift Data Foundation components.

Use this solution during a site disaster to fail applications from the primary to the secondary site, and to relocate the application back to the primary site after restoring the disaster site.

This synchronous solution is only available to metropolitan distance data centers with a 10 millisecond latency or less.
