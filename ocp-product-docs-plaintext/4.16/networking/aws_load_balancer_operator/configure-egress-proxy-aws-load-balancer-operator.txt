# Configuring cluster-wide proxy


You can configure the cluster-wide proxy in the AWS Load Balancer Operator. After configuring the cluster-wide proxy, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically updates all the deployments of the Operators with the environment variables such as HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, and NO_PROXY. These variables are populated to the managed controller by the AWS Load Balancer Operator.

# Trusting the certificate authority of the cluster-wide proxy

1. Create the config map to contain the certificate authority (CA) bundle in the aws-load-balancer-operator namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n aws-load-balancer-operator create configmap trusted-ca
```

2. To inject the trusted CA bundle into the config map, add the config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true label to the config map by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n aws-load-balancer-operator label cm trusted-ca config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true
```

3. Update the AWS Load Balancer Operator subscription to access the config map in the AWS Load Balancer Operator deployment by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n aws-load-balancer-operator patch subscription aws-load-balancer-operator --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"config":{"env":[{"name":"TRUSTED_CA_CONFIGMAP_NAME","value":"trusted-ca"}],"volumes":[{"name":"trusted-ca","configMap":{"name":"trusted-ca"}}],"volumeMounts":[{"name":"trusted-ca","mountPath":"/etc/pki/tls/certs/albo-tls-ca-bundle.crt","subPath":"ca-bundle.crt"}]}}}'
```

4. After the AWS Load Balancer Operator is deployed, verify that the CA bundle is added to the aws-load-balancer-operator-controller-manager deployment by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n aws-load-balancer-operator exec deploy/aws-load-balancer-operator-controller-manager -c manager -- bash -c "ls -l /etc/pki/tls/certs/albo-tls-ca-bundle.crt; printenv TRUSTED_CA_CONFIGMAP_NAME"
```

Example output

```terminal
-rw-r--r--. 1 root 1000690000 5875 Jan 11 12:25 /etc/pki/tls/certs/albo-tls-ca-bundle.crt
trusted-ca
```

5. Optional: Restart deployment of the AWS Load Balancer Operator every time the config map changes by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n aws-load-balancer-operator rollout restart deployment/aws-load-balancer-operator-controller-manager
```
