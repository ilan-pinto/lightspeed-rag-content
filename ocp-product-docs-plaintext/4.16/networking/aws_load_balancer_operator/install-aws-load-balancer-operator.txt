# Installing the AWS Load Balancer Operator


The AWS Load Balancer Operator deploys and manages the AWS Load Balancer Controller. You can install the AWS Load Balancer Operator from the OperatorHub by using Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or CLI.

# Installing the AWS Load Balancer Operator by using the web console

You can install the AWS Load Balancer Operator by using the web console.

* You have logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as a user with cluster-admin permissions.
* Your cluster is configured with AWS as the platform type and cloud provider.
* If you are using a security token service (STS) or user-provisioned infrastructure, follow the related preparation steps. For example, if you are using AWS Security Token Service, see "Preparing for the AWS Load Balancer Operator on a cluster using the AWS Security Token Service (STS)".

1. Navigate to Operators â†’ OperatorHub in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
2. Select the AWS Load Balancer Operator. You can use the Filter by keyword text box or use the filter list to search for the AWS Load Balancer Operator from the list of Operators.
3. Select the aws-load-balancer-operator namespace.
4. On the Install Operator page, select the following options:
1. Update the channel as stable-v1.
2. Installation mode as All namespaces on the cluster (default).
3. Installed Namespace as aws-load-balancer-operator. If the aws-load-balancer-operator namespace does not exist, it gets created during the Operator installation.
4. Select Update approval as Automatic or Manual. By default, the Update approval is set to Automatic. If you select automatic updates, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without any intervention. If you select manual updates, the OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to update the Operator updated to the new version.
5. Click Install.

* Verify that the AWS Load Balancer Operator shows the Status as Succeeded on the Installed Operators dashboard.

# Installing the AWS Load Balancer Operator by using the CLI

You can install the AWS Load Balancer Operator by using the CLI.

* You are logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as a user with cluster-admin permissions.
* Your cluster is configured with AWS as the platform type and cloud provider.
* You are logged into the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Create a Namespace object:
1. Create a YAML file that defines the Namespace object:
Example namespace.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: aws-load-balancer-operator
```

2. Create the Namespace object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f namespace.yaml
```

2. Create an OperatorGroup object:
1. Create a YAML file that defines the OperatorGroup object:
Example operatorgroup.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: aws-lb-operatorgroup
  namespace: aws-load-balancer-operator
spec:
  upgradeStrategy: Default
```

2. Create the OperatorGroup object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f operatorgroup.yaml
```

3. Create a Subscription object:
1. Create a YAML file that defines the Subscription object:
Example subscription.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: aws-load-balancer-operator
  namespace: aws-load-balancer-operator
spec:
  channel: stable-v1
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: aws-load-balancer-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
```

2. Create the Subscription object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f subscription.yaml
```


1. Get the name of the install plan from the subscription:

```terminal
$ oc -n aws-load-balancer-operator \
    get subscription aws-load-balancer-operator \
    --template='{{.status.installplan.name}}{{"\n"}}'
```

2. Check the status of the install plan:

```terminal
$ oc -n aws-load-balancer-operator \
    get ip <install_plan_name> \
    --template='{{.status.phase}}{{"\n"}}'
```


The output must be Complete.
