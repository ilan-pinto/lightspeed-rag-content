# Secured routes


Secure routes provide the ability to use several types of TLS termination to serve certificates to the client. The following sections describe how to create re-encrypt, edge, and passthrough routes with custom certificates.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you create routes in Microsoft Azure through public endpoints, the resource
names are subject to restriction. You cannot create resources that use certain
terms. For a list of terms that Azure restricts, see
Resolve reserved resource name errors
in the Azure documentation.

# Creating a re-encrypt route with a custom certificate

You can configure a secure route using reencrypt TLS termination with a custom
certificate by using the oc create route command.

* You must have a certificate/key pair in PEM-encoded files, where the certificate
is valid for the route host.
* You may have a separate CA certificate in a PEM-encoded file that completes
the certificate chain.
* You must have a separate destination CA certificate in a PEM-encoded file.
* You must have a service that you want to expose.


[NOTE]
----
Password protected key files are not supported. To remove a passphrase from a
key file, use the following command:

```terminal
$ openssl rsa -in password_protected_tls.key -out tls.key
```

----

This procedure creates a Route resource with a custom certificate and
reencrypt TLS termination. The following assumes that the certificate/key pair
are in the tls.crt and tls.key files in the current working directory. You
must also specify a destination CA certificate to enable the Ingress Controller
to trust the service&#8217;s certificate. You may also specify a CA certificate if
needed to complete the certificate chain. Substitute the actual path names for
tls.crt, tls.key, cacert.crt, and (optionally) ca.crt. Substitute the
name of the Service resource that you want to expose for frontend.
Substitute the appropriate hostname for www.example.com.

* Create a secure Route resource using reencrypt TLS termination and a custom
certificate:

```terminal
$ oc create route reencrypt --service=frontend --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key --dest-ca-cert=destca.crt --ca-cert=ca.crt --hostname=www.example.com
```


If you examine the resulting Route resource, it should look similar to the
following:
YAML Definition of the Secure Route

```yaml
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  host: www.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: frontend
  tls:
    termination: reencrypt
    key: |-
      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
      [...]
      -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    certificate: |-
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [...]
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    caCertificate: |-
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [...]
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    destinationCACertificate: |-
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [...]
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

# Creating an edge route with a custom certificate

You can configure a secure route using edge TLS termination with a custom
certificate by using the oc create route command. With an edge route, the
Ingress Controller terminates TLS encryption before forwarding traffic to the
destination pod. The route specifies the TLS certificate and key that the
Ingress Controller uses for the route.

* You must have a certificate/key pair in PEM-encoded files, where the certificate
is valid for the route host.
* You may have a separate CA certificate in a PEM-encoded file that completes
the certificate chain.
* You must have a service that you want to expose.


[NOTE]
----
Password protected key files are not supported. To remove a passphrase from a
key file, use the following command:

```terminal
$ openssl rsa -in password_protected_tls.key -out tls.key
```

----

This procedure creates a Route resource with a custom certificate and edge TLS
termination. The following assumes that the certificate/key pair are in the
tls.crt and tls.key files in the current working directory. You may also
specify a CA certificate if needed to complete the certificate chain.
Substitute the actual path names for tls.crt, tls.key, and (optionally)
ca.crt. Substitute the name of the service that you want to expose
for frontend. Substitute the appropriate hostname for www.example.com.

* Create a secure Route resource using edge TLS termination and a custom certificate.

```terminal
$ oc create route edge --service=frontend --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key --ca-cert=ca.crt --hostname=www.example.com
```


If you examine the resulting Route resource, it should look similar to the
following:
YAML Definition of the Secure Route

```yaml
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  host: www.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: frontend
  tls:
    termination: edge
    key: |-
      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
      [...]
      -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    certificate: |-
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [...]
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    caCertificate: |-
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [...]
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```


See oc create route edge --help for more options.

# Creating a passthrough route

You can configure a secure route using passthrough termination by using the oc create route command. With passthrough termination, encrypted traffic is sent straight to the destination without the router providing TLS termination. Therefore no key or certificate is required on the route.

* You must have a service that you want to expose.

* Create a Route resource:

```terminal
$ oc create route passthrough route-passthrough-secured --service=frontend --port=8080
```


If you examine the resulting Route resource, it should look similar to the following:
A Secured Route Using Passthrough Termination

```yaml
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: route-passthrough-secured 1
spec:
  host: www.example.com
  port:
    targetPort: 8080
  tls:
    termination: passthrough 2
    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: None 3
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: frontend
```

The name of the object, which is limited to 63 characters.
The termination field is set to passthrough. This is the only required tls field.
Optional insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy. The only valid values are None, Redirect, or empty for disabled.

The destination pod is responsible for serving certificates for the
traffic at the endpoint. This is currently the only method that can support requiring client certificates, also known as two-way authentication.
