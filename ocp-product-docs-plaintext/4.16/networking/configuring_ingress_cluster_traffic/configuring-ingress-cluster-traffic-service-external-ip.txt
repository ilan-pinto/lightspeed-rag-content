# Configuring ingress cluster traffic for a service external IP


You can attach an external IP address to a service so that it is available to traffic outside the cluster.
This is generally useful only for a cluster installed on bare metal hardware.
The external network infrastructure must be configured correctly to route traffic to the service.

# Prerequisites

* Your cluster is configured with ExternalIPs enabled. For more information, read Configuring ExternalIPs for services.

[NOTE]
----
Do not use the same ExternalIP for the egress IP.

# Attaching an ExternalIP to a service

You can attach an ExternalIP to a service. If your cluster is configured to allocate an ExternalIP automatically, you might not need to manually attach an ExternalIP to the service.

1. Optional: To confirm what IP address ranges are configured for use with ExternalIP, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get networks.config cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.externalIP}{"\n"}'
```


If autoAssignCIDRs is set, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform automatically assigns an ExternalIP to a new Service object if the spec.externalIPs field is not specified.
2. Attach an ExternalIP to the service.
1. If you are creating a new service, specify the spec.externalIPs field and provide an array of one or more valid IP addresses. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: svc-with-externalip
spec:
  ...
  externalIPs:
  - 192.174.120.10
```

2. If you are attaching an ExternalIP to an existing service, enter the following command. Replace <name> with the service name. Replace <ip_address> with a valid ExternalIP address. You can provide multiple IP addresses separated by commas.

```terminal
$ oc patch svc <name> -p \
  '{
    "spec": {
      "externalIPs": [ "<ip_address>" ]
    }
  }'
```


For example:

```terminal
$ oc patch svc mysql-55-rhel7 -p '{"spec":{"externalIPs":["192.174.120.10"]}}'
```

Example output

```terminal
"mysql-55-rhel7" patched
```

3. To confirm that an ExternalIP address is attached to the service, enter the following command. If you specified an ExternalIP for a new service, you must create the service first.

```terminal
$ oc get svc
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME               CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)    AGE
mysql-55-rhel7     172.30.131.89   192.174.120.10  3306/TCP   13m
```
